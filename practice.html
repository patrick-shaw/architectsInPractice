                    <h3 class="pb-lg-4">About Us</h3>
                    <p>We are ARCHITECTS IN PRACTICE â€“ a London-based design studio renowned for creating innovative,
                        playful and environmentally conscious buildings. We are diverse practitioners who are passionate
                        about architecture and how it can positively shape the built-environment.
                        <br><br>
                        We are progressive, ambitious and constantly evolving, and we work with like-minded clients to
                        promote and execute ideas that make a positive impact on the buildings and spaces we work with.
                        This, we believe, comes about through client collaboration, building innovation and
                        environmental awareness.
                        <br><br>
                        We take on complex briefs and refine them to create simple yet elegant architecture, and all of
                        our projects are rooted in extensive research and designed for measurable impact.

                    <h3 class="pb-lg-4">Why Us?</h3>
                    <p>We are lovers of all things architectural.
                        <br><br>
                        We love our work, have fun doing it and are proud of what we do. We have an incredibly talented,
                        diverse and resourceful team who are passionate about what we build as well as how we build. We
                        promote environmental awareness while pushing the boundaries with building innovation.
                        <br><br>
                        We believe outstanding environmentally driven architecture is derived from a collaborative
                        process, which we engage in from the outset. Our design approach is to use physical models,
                        workshops and presentations to communicate ideas in an informal manner, whether this being with
                        stakeholders, residents or local authorities. Yet our creativity is not limited to traditional
                        analogue processes, but we harness the latest technology to create immersive experiences using
                        virtual and augmented reality as a way of developing and communicating our designs.
                        <br><br>
                        We are always seeking new and exciting opportunities, therefore if you feel we are the right
                        practice for you please do get in touch.

                    <h3 class="pb-lg-4">Analogue</h3>
                    <p>Making physical models is a fundamental part of our design process.
                        <br><br>
                        We use physical models from the outset to convey qualities of the project that other methods
                        cannot. We also find them to be an effective tool to communicate ideas with clients, planning
                        authorities and project teams.
                        <br><br>
                        The process alone often brings out new design ideas for discussion, and we encourage all
                        projects to be developed in this way, from simple concepts to presentation models, we find this
                        approach encourages collaboration throughout, something we believe benefits the project as a
                        whole.

                    <p>We integrate virtual and augmented reality into our daily BIM workflow.
                        <br><br>
                        With the use of cutting-edge virtual tools, we are able to delve into fully immersive
                        environments to explore every area and aspect of a project. We find this to be an immensely
                        powerful tool, one that can provide deeper understanding of the project and can offer greater
                        efficiency with decision making.
                        <br><br>
                        Using real-time visualisation, we are able to gain consensus and move forward quickly with
                        important design decisions.
